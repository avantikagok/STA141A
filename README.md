# STA141A

This is my final project for my STA141A course, taught by Dr. Chen at UC Davis. This project aims to build a predictive model using data from a mouse trial of turning a wheel in order to predict accurate movement by the mouse. 

To run this file on your own device, you will need to download sessions 1-18 worth of data and replace my lines of code that import the dataset into R from my local computer. 

I hope that this project is informative and interesting!
